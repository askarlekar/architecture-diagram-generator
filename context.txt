**Key Considerations:**

* **RTO/RPO:**  The specific RTO and RPO requirements (15 minutes RPO, near-zero RTO in some cases) will heavily influence the architecture and choice of GCP services.  Detailed configurations (e.g., synchronous vs. asynchronous replication) are crucial.
* **SIEM Tool Clustering:**  The clustering requirements for the SIEM tool should be carefully addressed.  Chronicle SIEM on GCP is a strong candidate, but its clustering capabilities must be evaluated against the RFPâ€™s criteria.
* **Compliance:**  Regulatory compliance needs (not explicitly mentioned but implied for core banking) should be considered when choosing services and designing the architecture.
* **Cost Optimization:**  While the RFP focuses on technical requirements, cost-effectiveness on GCP can be achieved through right-sizing resources, using sustained use discounts, and other optimization strategies.
* **Interoperability:**  The proposed solution must seamlessly integrate with existing systems.  GCP provides various integration options (e.g., APIs, service connectors) that should be factored in.
